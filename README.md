# secure-programming

This repository contains simple programs created in the Secure Programming course as independent course exercises. Each simple program demonstrates specific security concepts and vulnerabilities, organized into distinct sections.

## Sections

### 1. Overflow

This section focuses on various types of buffer overflows and related vulnerabilities.

- **t1.c**: A program that causes unlimited buffer overflow.
- **t2.c**: A program that causes off-by-one overflow.
- **t3.c**: A program that demonstrates heap overflow.
- **t4.c**: A program that exploits function pointer overflow.
- **t5.c**: A program showcasing a `printf` vulnerability.

### 2. Encryption and Authentication

This section covers secure cryptographic operations and authentication mechanisms.

- **t2.c**: A program that writes cryptographically secure random data to a file.
- **t3.c**: A program for user authentication using a username and password. Password hashes are stored in a file.
- **t4.c**: A program to encrypt and decrypt files.
